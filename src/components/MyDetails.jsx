        <p>
          I started my academic journey with <strong>SSC in 2018</strong> and completed my <strong>HSC in 2020</strong>. 
          In <strong>2022</strong>, I began my Bachelor's in <strong>Computer Science & Engineering (CSE)</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Alongside my academic studies, I developed an early interest in programming. 
          I started learning <strong>C programming</strong> in 2022 and gradually explored other languages and problem solving.
        </p>

        <p>
          In early <strong>2024</strong>, I focused seriously on web development and enrolled in the 
          <strong> Programming Hero Web Development course</strong>, which helped me master technologies like React, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
        </p>

        <p>
          My goal is to continuously grow as a developer and become a <strong>Senior Software Engineer</strong> in the future â€” someone who not only builds quality applications but also contributes to the tech community.
